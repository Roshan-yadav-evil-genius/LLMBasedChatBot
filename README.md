# LLM Based Chatbot
The LLM-based chat service is designed to convert users into clients. If a user stops responding, the system sends follow-up messages at specified intervals with new offers to encourage them to purchase the service. If the user expresses interest in buying, they are redirected to a sales representative to finalize the deal.
